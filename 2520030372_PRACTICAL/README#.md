The experiment is designed to observe process state transitions such as Ready, Running, Waiting, and Terminated using Linux monitoring tools like ps, top, and /proc
A process is created and executed, and its PID is identified using the ps command.
The top command is then used to monitor the process and observe its current state
Detailed information about a particular process can be obtained using cat /proc/PID/status, where the State field shows the current process state.
A process in the R state is running or ready to run, while an S state indicates that the process is sleeping or waiting for an event
When the process finishes execution, it enters the Terminated state and is removed from the normal process list.
Thus, ps, top, and /proc help in monitoring and understanding the different stages of a Linux process.
